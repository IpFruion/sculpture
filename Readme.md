# Welcome to Sculpture

This is a model (DTO) generation library that facilitates the interaction between reading in a schema and converting it to another languages schema.

Heavily inspired by [serde](https://serde.rs).

The main entry to this library using using the `Sculptor` trait by which you can define your own "sculpting" of the schema into some text or object.
